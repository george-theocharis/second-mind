# 🤖 Android 

### Articles

   In this article by Marcin Piekielny, you can find one of the few sources that describe domain driven design in
   Android.
2) [How the Repository pattern is misunderstood in Android](https://itnext.io/android-data-repository-a-simple-pattern-that-we-often-misunderstand-6a6fb13b5a81)
   
   In this article by Marcin Piekielny, we can see how the repository is sometimes misused in Android and we could actually 
do with this pattern.

# 🧪 Testing

### Articles
1) [Increase Test Fidelity By Avoiding Mocks](https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/02/increase-test-fidelity-by-avoiding-mocks.html)

   In this article by Google, it is advised to try to use real implementations or fakes as much as possible and to try to
avoid usage of mocks or mocking libraries. Something that I wholeheartedly agree. Mocks make tests coupled to implementation
details, are easily misused as both mocks and stubs and also add extra time in tests that little by little increases over
the course of a project.


### Youtube

   Showcasing different examples like Leap Year, Stacks and Queues, trying to lean in testing the specifications of
   a program.

in general.

based on his new experiences.

5) [Outside In TDD Account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHnuMjah6ps&list=PLXblePLf9LtPBeijGmVIv8dBv4uIi3JEa&ab_channel=Codurance)
