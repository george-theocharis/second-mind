# ðŸ¤– Android

# ðŸ§ª Testing

### Articles
1) [Increase Test Fidelity By Avoiding Mocks](https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/02/increase-test-fidelity-by-avoiding-mocks.html)

   In this article by Google, it is advised to try to use real implementations or fakes as much as possible and to try to
avoid usage of mocks or mocking libraries. Something that I wholeheartedly agree. Mocks make tests coupled to implementation
details, are easily misused as both mocks and stubs and also add extra time in tests that little by little increases over
the course of a project.


### Youtube
1) [Structure and Interpretation of Test Cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWn8RA_DEic&ab_channel=NDCConferences)

   In this video, Kevlin Henney describes how proper structure and naming can elevate tests.
   Showcasing different examples like Leap Year, Stacks and Queues, trying to lean in testing the specifications of
   a program.
2) [Does TDD Really Lead to Good Design?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyFVA4Spcgg&ab_channel=DevTernityConference)

   In this video, Sandro Mancuso shows how you still need to make design decisions while using TDD and it's a great talk 
in general.
