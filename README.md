# üß™ Testing

### Articles
1) [Increase Test Fidelity By Avoiding Mocks](https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/02/increase-test-fidelity-by-avoiding-mocks.html)

   In this article by Google, it is advised to try to use real implementations or fakes as much as possible and to try to
avoid usage of mocks or mocking libraries. Something that I wholeheartedly agree. Mocks make tests coupled to implementation
details, are easily misused as both mocks and stubs and also add extra time in tests that little by little increases over
the course of a project.
